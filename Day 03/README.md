## üõ°Ô∏è Ethical Hacking: Introduction

**Ethical Hacking** (a.k.a. white-hat hacking) is the authorized practice of bypassing system security to identify potential data breaches and threats in a network.

Ethical hackers:
- Work with permission
- Help organizations fix vulnerabilities
- Use the same tools as malicious hackers, but legally

## üß† Types of Hacking in Ethical Hacking

### 1. **Wi-Fi Hacking**
- Cracking weak Wi-Fi passwords
- Using tools like `airmon-ng`, `airodump-ng`, and `aircrack-ng`
- Attacks: Deauthentication, Handshake capture

### 2. **Web Application Hacking**
- Finding bugs in websites (SQLi, XSS, CSRF)
- Tools: `Burp Suite`, `sqlmap`, `Nikto`, `OWASP ZAP`

### 3. **Network Hacking**
- Scanning ports and finding vulnerable services
- Tools: `nmap`, `netcat`, `Wireshark`

### 4. **System/OS Hacking**
- Exploiting vulnerabilities in operating systems
- Tools: `Metasploit`, `searchsploit`, `msfvenom`

### 5. **Social Engineering**
- Tricking people into giving up confidential data (like phishing)
- Tools: `Social-Engineer Toolkit (SET)`, `BeEF`

### 6. **Mobile Hacking**
- Testing vulnerabilities in Android/iOS apps
- Tools: `MobSF`, `Drozer`, `Frida`

### 7. **Reverse Engineering**
- Analyzing binaries and software to understand how they work
- Tools: `Ghidra`, `Radare2`, `IDA Free`

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Reminder:
Ethical hacking must always be done:
- **With permission**
- **Legally**
- **Responsibly**

**"Hack to protect, not to exploit."**
